Navigate to https://calm-scrubland-27592.herokuapp.com/ and log in. If you are a first-time user, click the "sign up" button and create an account. Once you have logged in or signed up, you will be taken to a page that lists all current tasks that you and your team members have posted. Choose any task to see its details. If the task is not yet assigned to anyone, you can click "Assign to Me" to claim that task. You will also need to enter an estimated date of completion for your task. If you would like to create a new task, just select "New Task" from the list page. You will be prompted to enter a title and short description of your task. When you return to the list page, you will see your new task has been added to the list. If you would like to see a list of users and how many tasks have been posted or completed by them  or assigned to them, click "Users" on the list page. There you will find all of this information, plus each user will have a badge that shows how many tasks they have completed. When it is time to sign out, just click "Sign Out" in the nav bar.

## Directions for Future Development
--Comparative/competitive features--badges for the employee who has completed the most tasks or who has done tasks in the shortest amount of time, for example.      
--Ability to do more with tasks--assign point values (higher points for more difficult tasks), add notes or comments, assign two or more users to a single task, attach files, etc.  
--Allow some users to be "admins" who can assign tasks to other users.  
--More visual representation of task timelines (Gantt chart). 
--Make tasks searchable.
